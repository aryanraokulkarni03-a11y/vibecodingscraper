Here are three variations for your launch post. Choose the one that fits your vibe!

## Option 1: The "Viral/Story" Approach (Best for Engagement)

**Headline**: I built an AI Agent that predicts the next big SaaS trend (so I don't have to). 🔮

Spending hours scrolling Product Hunt and Reddit for ideas is SO 2025.

I realized I was wasting 10 hours a week just *looking* for problems to solve. So I spent this weekend automating it.

Meet the **Vibe-Coding Trend Scraper**.

It’s an AI agent that:
1.  🕵️‍♂️ **Scouts**: Hits Reddit, Bluesky, and Hacker News simultaneously.
2.  🧠 **Thinks**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to analyze 1000s of posts.
3.  📉 **Reports**: Delivers a daily "Vibe Score" report on what's trending.

It even auto-switches to Groq (Llama 3) if Gemini hits a rate limit. Zero cost. Full autonomy.

I'm open-sourcing it today. You can clone it, run it, and find your next startup idea by breakfast.

## Option 2: The "Technical/Developer" Approach

**Headline**: Python + Gemini 2.5 + Playwright = The Ultimate Market Research Agent 🤖

Just shipped a new open-source tool: **Vibe-Coding Trend Scraper**.

It’s a robust, async scraper/agent designed to identify emerging SaaS opportunities before they go mainstream.

**The Stack:**
*   **Python 3.11** (AsyncIO)
*   **Playwright** for dynamic scraping (Indie Hackers, Product Hunt)
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for high-volume token processing
*   **Groq/Llama 3** for fallback redundancy
*   **SQLite** for granular history & deduplication

It handles rate limits, rotates user agents, and generates reader-friendly HTML reports automatically.

Check out the code (and the Agentic architecture):

## Option 3: The "Short & Punchy" Approach

Stop guessing what to build. Start building what people want. 💡

I built a tool that scrapes the internet (Reddit, HN, Bluesky), analyzes the noise with AI, and tells me exactly which simple SaaS ideas are trending *right now*.

It's called Vibe-Coding Trend Scraper.
It's free.
It's open source.
